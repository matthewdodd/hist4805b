# Refining the Question

To refine the question I have to ask the 5W's and How.

The primary questions is: How much information does the Metropolitan Museum give out freely that can either implicate or keep safe the curatorial staff from the illicit antiquities trade?

WHO
 - Universities and museums
 
WHAT
 - Grab data on Ancient Rome and Greece materials
 - Clean up data into usable '.csv'
 - Visualize data and determine major factors
 - discuss major factors and implications

WHERE
 - From Met museum, grab with R scripts
 - start with google and see if personal websites exists
 - check JSTOR for other information
 - see if the antiquities project (Chasing Aphrodite) has anything

WHEN
 - Pre-500 AD objects

WHY
 - to determine a network map of links in the movement of antiquities and the legal rights
 - to examine the extent to which the museums are using or affecting the illicit antiquities trade

HOW
 - R scripts for grabbing data
 - R scripts for visualization
 - Palad.io for visualization
 - use a github repo to store all data
 - final design should be in a major presentation
