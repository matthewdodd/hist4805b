# WeekEndingOnJanuary17

- I began by grabbing as much data as I could using import.io to do the bulk of the work.
 - I remembered that the last time I had used import.io I had forgotten to keep a log, so I checked that box.
- A major problem is that the Met Museum doesn't use any form of standarization across different pages.
 - In the first two pages examined, one had a 'Period:' text field ad the other did not, which import.io cannot understand.
 - To overcome this I attempted to utilise the search results, but import.io does not accept modified search results (which is to say results that I am looking for under Greek and Roman Art, but rather removes those parameters and just gives the entire collection of the Met Museum again.).
    - The issue faced here, is that only 17301 records matter to me for the purpose of this project, but import.io cannot focus onto just those records and instead is modifying the search parameters to contain all 403773 records, over 386000 more results than are wanted.
- My conclusion after attempting to make import.io work as best as possible is that I may have to resort to using the R script from R OpenSci to try and gather what information I need.
- I had not anticipated spending as much time on data gathering as I have and more time will be necessary. import.io has been frustrating to work with, annd I have chosen to find another route.
