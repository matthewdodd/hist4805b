#Palladio Visualization
- I ran the final clean grab (currently 6b) through Palladio
 - Using the 'Graph' function in Palladio, regardless of parameters, becomes virtually unusable, a different kind of cleaning will need to happen
 - Using the 'Duration' function in Palladio with the parameters: 'Tooltip Label: Accession Number,' 'Y-Grouping: Credit Line,' 'X-Grouping: Culture,' and 'X-Sort: Accession Number'
 - Using the 'Duration' function in Palladio with the parameters: 'Tooltip Label: Accession Number,' 'Y-Grouping: Culture,' 'X-Grouping: Credit Line,' and 'X-Sort: Accession Number'
 - Using the 'Duration' function in Palladio with the parameters: 'Tooltip Label: Accession Number,' 'Y-Grouping: Credit Line,' 'X-Grouping: Text,' and 'X-Sort: Accession Number'
- In the 'Graph' case:
 - I think it would be wise to shrink the 'Credit Line' in a different file: ex. 'Anonymous Gift 1925' to 'Anonymous Gift' by removing the superfluous specifics
- In the first 'Duration' case:
 - Subscription, J. Pierpont Morgan, Rogers Fund, Edward C. Moore, W. Gedney Beatty are the most common Credit Lines by Culture
- In the second 'Duration' case:
 - Roman, Cypriot, Greek Attic, Greek, Etruscan in this order are the most common cultures that exist in the Met Museum (by Credit Line) (NULL-CULTURE appears as the third most common culture[the Met needs to classify these])
- In the third 'Duration' case:
 - Subscription, J. Pierpont Morgan, Rogers Fund, Edward C. Moore, W. Gedney Beatty, Richard B. Seager are the most common Credit Lines by Text

 
- My conclusion on Palladio for this period is that much can be easily seen, including some of the most important donors (J. Pierpont Morgan [Sr./Jr.?]; Rogers?; Edward C. Moore?)
 - Why do these people matter and appear so often?
 - Where else are they connected?
 - If one donor is compared to a period, date, culture, etc. what comes out of it?
