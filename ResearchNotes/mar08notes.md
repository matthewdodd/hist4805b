# Valuation of objects
- The top 13 creditors for objects to the Met Museum:
 - Cesnola Collection: 5230
 - Rogers Fund: 2721
 - Purchase: 1436
 - J. Pierpont Morgan: 1411
 - Edward C. Moore: 644
 - Fletcher Fund: 611
 - W. Gedney Beatty: 527
 - Richard B. Seager: 473
 - Henry G. Marquand: 379
 - American Society for the Exploration/Excavation of Sardis: 360
 - John Taylor Johnston: 282
 - American Exploration Society: 246
 - A.J.B. Wace: 239
 - Total comes to: 14559; 13 Sources of 559 distinct creditors gives 2.3% of creditors; This means that 2.3% account for 85.35% of objects
- When the various classifications are pulled into a larger table (using Excel this time) it becomes interesting
 - Certain creditors/donators give a large amount of one thing and very little of another: J.P. Morgan with 822/1411 being glass objects, Edward C. Moore with 612/644 being glass objects, W. Gedney Beatty with 497/527 being gems, John Taylor Johnston with 281/282 being gems, and A.J.B Wace with 180/239 being lead objects
 - When this is visualized using a 'doughnut' graph we can see, from inside (being the most objects credited) to the outside (being the least objects credited [of the major creditors]) and including the 'all other creditors' the coloured representations by size (in degrees covered) clearly illustrates what classifications the met museum has the most of under the umbrella heading of 'Greek and Roman Art'
 - it is also very clear that when we examine the 13 largest donators, or even just the five largest donators, that: Bronze, Glass, and Vases are the most common objects donated
 - Further it is clear that: the majority of donations/sales to the Met Museum for 'Greek and Roman Art' came prior to the 1970 UNESCO Convention on Protection of Cultural Property, although this hasn't stopped the purchase or collecting of objects.
