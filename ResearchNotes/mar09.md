- When looking at the creditorsGraphed.xlsx the doughnut is a poor representation because it makes a simple assumption
 - All of the creditors must equal the same overall value. It thus distorts how many objects each of the creditors is donating.
 - It also stretches all of the conclusions that can be drawn about any of the creditors or objects by changing the perceived values of each.
- If creditorsGraphed.xlsx were examined as a stacked bar graph (compare percent vs. numeric value) does this better represent the number of creditors or objects?
- What if this stacked bar graph had its axis flipped, does this better or worse represent the data?
